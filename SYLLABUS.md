# New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME): Creating and Composing Unique Interactive Performances

## Description
Students will learn how to create a New Interface for Musical Expression, or NIME. They will understand how to effectively map sensory data onto custom interfaces designed to generate sound as an expressive musical instrument. Using a strong, hands-on approach, students will learn about electronic music composition, sound design, synthesis, effects processing, musical form, structure, development, and nonstandard notational principles. The course will culminate in an end-of-semester concert where students will perform original works, complete with NIME-specific notation, composed to showcase their NIMEs.

## Prerequisite
A laptop running macOS or Windows will be required for the course. Chromebooks will not suffice.

---

## Learning Outcomes
* Learn to play and perform their NIMEs
* ALL ELSE PENDING

---

## Assignments
* A mid-course presentation of the development of your NIME project (25%)
* A final performance, complete with score, of your NIME (55%)

---

## Grading
* Mid-course presentation of the development of your NIME project (25%)
* NIME showcase as a final performance, complete with score, (55%)
* Score/sketch associated with your NIME (10%)
* Attendance (10%)

## Software Requirements/Associated Costs
The costs associated with this course depends on the kind of NIME you choose to create. A software-based NIME, for example, might involve Max and an Arduino microcomputer, both of which are standard for this course. Together, they will cost about $99.

If, on the other hand, you design an analog-based NIME, one where you might be striking a membrane with a physical device, then your costs would depend on whether youâ€™re using found objects, building the items from off-the-shelf parts, or a combination of the aforementioned.
