# New Interfaces for Musical Expression (NIME): Creating and Composing Unique Interactive Performances

## Description
This course will walk students through the process of creating a New Interface for Musical Expression, or <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="New Interface for Musical Expression">nime</abbr></span>, and use it to compose and perform an original musical work. Students will learn skills in both technical and creative fields in order to effectively capture sensory data and transform them into sound. Various topics in electronic music composition will be covered to give students a wide range of possible directions in which to develop their <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="New Interface for Musical Expression">nime</abbr></span>s. This includes computer programming for audio, sound design and effects processing, musical structure, fabrication, and electronic circuitry. The course concludes with a concert in which students perform original compositions for their <span class="small-caps"><abbr title="New Interface for Musical Expression">nime</abbr></span>s.

## Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this course, students will understand...

* How to create a New Interface for Musical Expression, or NIME;
* How to play and perform their NIMEs;
* How to map sensory data onto custom interfaces designed to generate sound as an expressive musical instrument;
* And, how to compose elementary electronic compositions.

## Grading
* Mid-course presentation of the development of your NIME project (25%)
* NIME showcase as a final performance, complete with score, (55%)
* Score/sketch associated with your NIME (10%)
* Attendance (10%)

## Software Requirements/Associated Costs
The costs associated with this course depends on the kind of NIME you choose to create. A software-based NIME, for example, might involve Max and an Arduino microcomputer, both of which are standard for this course. Together, they will cost about $99.

If, on the other hand, you design an analog-based NIME, one where you might be striking a membrane with a physical device, then your costs would depend on whether youâ€™re using found objects, building the items from off-the-shelf parts, or a combination of the aforementioned.
